			<h1> Baltimore Civic Data Information </h1>
			<h2> Further Use of 311 Calls Data </h2>
			<p> This website and the visualizations were created as an example of the uses of the Baltimore Civic Data. </p>
			<p> The following ideas demonstrate further use of the data: </p>
			<ol>
				<li> Use population information to normalize the calls over population density. 
				Currently the data is divided according to Zip code, whereas population information
				is only available according to the divisions used for census data. Normalization would allowed for more accurate analysis to be made of the information displayed. </li>
				<li> Statistical analysis using the normalized data could be used to explore economics conditions of various parts of Baltimore. Temporal patterns and/or correlations between different factors could be discerned and used for research.</li>
				<li> If patterns are found in the data, preventive measuares could be taken for high problem areas leading to lower overall costs for the city. For instance, recurring rat problems in certain areas could be identified and community or city measure taken to reduce the problem and prevent further spreading of the problem into surrounding areas.</li>
